## Usage examples
Note that default prefix for commands is `!`

### Seeing help

`!help` - displays list of available commands

`!help [command]` - displays help for specified command

`!help [command] detailed` - displays all available help for this command

### User format

Various commands need specified user while executing command (like `ban`).
Those commands can accept user in those formats:
- discord mentions
- <@USERID> or <@!USERID>
- @USERNAME#1234 (NOTE: This method will return user only when it's already in cache)


### Kicking and banning users

`ban` and `kick` commands have the same syntax so those examples will work for both. 

`!ban @User reason Rules violation` - bans mentioned user with specified reason

`!kick @USERNAME#1234` - kicks user without specified reason

### Purge

Delete messages in large numbers (up to 100 / usage).

NOTE: Expressions containing more than one word can be grouped as follows `"expression with 4 words"`

List of all available filters:
  * `contains [expression]`
  * `equals [expression]`
  * `startswith [expression]`
  * `endswith [expression]`
  * `from [user]`
  * `has [file / embed / mentions / invites / reactions]`

`!purge amount 55 from @User has mentions contains "lol"` - from last 55 messages, delete those sent by mentioned user, containing at least one mention and word "lol"

`!purge amount 10 equals "smh"` - from the last 10 messages, delete those which content is equal to "smh"

### Censoring

Managing censored expressions. 
`!censored` - displays list of all censored expressions

`!censored add [expression] [expression] ...` - add new expression(s)

`!censored remove [expression]` - remove expression(s)

### Config
